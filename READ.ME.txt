Welcome to Culture Shock UK! (which is often abbreviated as CSUK throughout the file naming and variable assignment of
this project.)

CSUK is supposed to serve as a light-hearted, educational game for those who are travelling to the UK for the first
time, or would, perhaps, generally like to learn more about British culture.

The aim of the game is to get from the city airport to Premier Inn and arrive with enough cash and energy. The player
starts with £50 and 100 energy and must arrive at the Premier Inn with £10 or more and 20 energy or more.

Upon starting a new game, the player is prompted to create a new character including a name, a gender and a country of
origin. The player subsequently starts in Pyford (a not so imaginative, fictional city name where the game is based)
International Airport. Within the airport the player can purchase their items to help them throughout the game. The
game includes save and load functionality which can be implemented at up to three various checkpoints.

A breakdown of all the files is given below:

-- gameplay_csuk.py - RUN THIS FILE TO PLAY GAME. Imports the character class from character_csuk.py and all methods
                      from levels_csuk to enable the player to interact with the world (Pyford).

-- character_csuk.py - contains character class with all it's attributes and methods.

-- levels_csuk.py - contains all methods which form each level of Pyford.

-- save_csuk.txt - contains saved player data which can be reused when a game is loaded.

-- test_csuk.py - shows evidence of attempted unittests of the character class and some of the methods associated with
                  it.
